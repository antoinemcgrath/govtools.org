     Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
 tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,
 SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
     This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Statutes at Large
 Modernization Act’’.
 SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
     Congress finds the following:
         (1) The United States was established under ‘‘a
     government of laws, and not of men’’.
         (2) The rule of law requires that the laws be
     available to the people.
         (3) Active, permanent laws are codified in the
     United States Code, which is maintained by the Of-
     fice of the Law Revision Counsel at http://
     uscode.house.gov/.
         (4) The United States Code usually does not in-
     clude, however, repealed laws, original statutes that
     have since been amended, or those with limited du-
     ration such as appropriations acts. Furthermore, un-
     codified titles of the United States Code are merely
     ‘‘evidence’’ of the law before the judicial branch, so
     attorneys must consult the United States Statutes at
     Large.
         (5) The United States Statutes at Large is
     compiled by the National Archives and Records Ad-
     ministration. It is legal and permanent evidence of
     all the laws enacted during a session of Congress be-
     ginning with the First Congress in 1789. It also
     contains  concurrent  resolutions,  reorganization
     plans, proposed and ratified amendments to the
     Constitution of the United States, and proclamations
     by the President.
         (6) The Statutes at Large collection is pub-
     lished under the direction of the Office of the Fed-
     eral Register through the Congressional Printing
     Management Division of the Government Publishing
     Office.
         (7) The Law Library of Congress has begun to
     digitize the Statutes at Large. It has published all
     volumes in a text-over-PDF format. They appear as
     scanned PDF images with basic search capability.
         (8) More resources are needed to adequately re-
     fine and structure the embedded data elements that
     enable advanced search functions, machine read-
     ability, and other useful options.
         (9) The Government Publishing Office is the
     appropriate entity to lead the online digitization of
     the Statutes at Large in collaboration with other
     Federal and private entities with expertise in devel-
     oping formatting conventions for legislative mate-
     rials.
         (10) Incorporating relevant digital information
     into www.Congress.gov would make it a more useful
     and comprehensive research resource.
