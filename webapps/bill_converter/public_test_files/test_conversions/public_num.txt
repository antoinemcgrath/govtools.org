 1     Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
 2 tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,
 3 SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
 4     This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Statutes at Large
 5 Modernization Act’’.
 6 SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
 7     Congress finds the following:
 8         (1) The United States was established under ‘‘a
 9     government of laws, and not of men’’.
 1         (2) The rule of law requires that the laws be
 2     available to the people.
 3         (3) Active, permanent laws are codified in the
 4     United States Code, which is maintained by the Of-
 5     fice of the Law Revision Counsel at http://
 6     uscode.house.gov/.
 7         (4) The United States Code usually does not in-
 8     clude, however, repealed laws, original statutes that
 9     have since been amended, or those with limited du-
 10     ration such as appropriations acts. Furthermore, un-
 11     codified titles of the United States Code are merely
 12     ‘‘evidence’’ of the law before the judicial branch, so
 13     attorneys must consult the United States Statutes at
 14     Large.
 15         (5) The United States Statutes at Large is
 16     compiled by the National Archives and Records Ad-
 17     ministration. It is legal and permanent evidence of
 18     all the laws enacted during a session of Congress be-
 19     ginning with the First Congress in 1789. It also
 20     contains  concurrent  resolutions,  reorganization
 21     plans, proposed and ratified amendments to the
 22     Constitution of the United States, and proclamations
 23     by the President.
 24         (6) The Statutes at Large collection is pub-
 25     lished under the direction of the Office of the Fed-
 1     eral Register through the Congressional Printing
 2     Management Division of the Government Publishing
 3     Office.
 4         (7) The Law Library of Congress has begun to
 5     digitize the Statutes at Large. It has published all
 6     volumes in a text-over-PDF format. They appear as
 7     scanned PDF images with basic search capability.
 8         (8) More resources are needed to adequately re-
 9     fine and structure the embedded data elements that
 10     enable advanced search functions, machine read-
 11     ability, and other useful options.
 12         (9) The Government Publishing Office is the
 13     appropriate entity to lead the online digitization of
 14     the Statutes at Large in collaboration with other
 15     Federal and private entities with expertise in devel-
 16     oping formatting conventions for legislative mate-
 17     rials.
 18         (10) Incorporating relevant digital information
 19     into www.Congress.gov would make it a more useful
 20     and comprehensive research resource.
