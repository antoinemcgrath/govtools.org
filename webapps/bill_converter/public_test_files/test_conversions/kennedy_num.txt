 1     Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
 2 tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,
 3 SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
 4     This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Kennedy–King Estab-
 5 lishment Act of 2018’’.
 6 SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
 7     Congress finds that—
 8         (1) on April 4, 1968, Robert F. Kennedy was
 9     scheduled to give a speech in Indianapolis, Indiana,
 1     during the campaign of Mr. Kennedy for the presi-
 2     dency of the United States;
 3         (2) just before giving the prepared remarks,
 4     Mr. Kennedy was informed of the assassination of
 5     Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., before the news be-
 6     came widely known publicly;
 7         (3) Mr. Kennedy changed the prepared remarks
 8     to inform the large gathering of the death of Dr.
 9     King in a manner that called for a nonviolent reac-
 10     tion to the violent death;
 11         (4) the call of Mr. Kennedy for nonviolence in
 12     a moment of unbearable pain helped temper the re-
 13     action of people in Indianapolis to the assassination
 14     of Dr. King, such that, while many other cities
 15     erupted in violence and rioting, Indianapolis did not
 16     suffer riots or bloodshed in the days after the assas-
 17     sination of Dr. King;
 18         (5) the speech of Mr. Kennedy on the volatile
 19     occasion has been described as 1 of the great ad-
 20     dresses of the 20th century, calling for unity in a
 21     time of great unrest;
 22         (6) the heartfelt leadership of Mr. Kennedy and
 23     call for nonviolence in the face of violence, prior to
 24     the assassination of Mr. Kennedy, continues to be a
 25     model for people of the United States;
 1         (7) the park site at which the speech was held
 2     was established in 1961 and has served the commu-
 3     nity as a gathering place for social movements and
 4     engagement, which is the reason why the site was
 5     selected as the location for the speech of Mr. Ken-
 6     nedy;
 7         (8) a memorial sculpture, known as ‘‘Landmark
 8     for Peace’’, honoring Mr. Kennedy and Dr. King
 9     was erected on the site in 1994 to commemorate the
 10     events of April 4, 1968, and the message of non-
 11     violence taught by Mr. Kennedy and Dr. King;
 12         (9) the improvised remarks of Mr. Kennedy to
 13     a stricken community continue to resonate today
 14     and the site continues to inspire social engagement
 15     with the words of Mr. Kennedy, ‘‘Why don’t we
 16     make a monument to peace where all of us can live
 17     together, not with walls coming up but with walls
 18     tearing down, so we can go forward together?’’; and
 19         (10) the site of the speech given by Mr. Ken-
 20     nedy on April 4, 1968, should be preserved as a na-
 21     tional treasure, and the preservation of the site is
 22     most fitting on the 50th anniversary of the speech.
